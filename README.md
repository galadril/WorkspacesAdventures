    - 
2.  **Start a workspace from the issue**:    
    -   Once the issue is created, you can **start a GitHub Workspace** directly from the issue page.
    -   This will automatically set up your development environment tailored to the task at hand.
    - 
3.  **Use GitHub Workspace to plan and fix the issue**:    
    -   Inside the workspace, explore the project files, understand the issue, and start planning your approach.
    -   **GitHub Copilot** will be available to help you write code, fix bugs, and implement features based on the issue you’re tackling.
    - 
4.  **Test your changes in GitHub Codespaces**:    
    -   When you’re ready to test your changes, switch to **GitHub Codespaces**.
    -   **Codespaces** provides a fully-configured environment to run, debug, and test your code in real-time.
    - 
5.  **Submit your solution**:    
    -   Once you've completed your task and confirmed your changes work in Codespaces, push your solution to the repository.
