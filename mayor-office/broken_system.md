# Broken System: Mayor's Annual Speech Generator

The mayor’s speech generator is broken! Every time the mayor tries to generate a speech, it either fails or produces garbled output. This is causing frustration and leading to protests in Codetropolis.

---

## Known Issues
- Policies are outdated and need refreshing.
- The speech generator sometimes crashes with no clear error.
- Policies are being randomly shuffled, creating confusion.

---

## Your Mission
1. Debug the `generate_speech` function in `policies.py` and ensure it works without errors.
2. Update the `POLICIES` list to reflect modern priorities for Codetropolis.
3. BONUS: Use the `randomize_policies` function to add an optional feature where the mayor can shuffle the policies intentionally for fun speeches.
