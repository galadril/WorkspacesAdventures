# 🛠️ Fix Mayor's Annual Speech Generator

The mayor’s speech generator is broken! Every time the mayor tries to generate a speech, it either fails or produces garbled output. This is causing frustration and leading to protests in Codetropolis. Your task is to debug and enhance it.

## Known Issues

- 📝 Policies are outdated and need refreshing.
- ⚠️ The speech generator sometimes crashes with no clear error.
- 🔄 Policies are being randomly shuffled, creating confusion.

## 🗺️ Mission Objectives

1. **Debug the `generate_speech` function**:
   - Ensure it works without errors.
   - Test for edge cases (e.g., empty policy list, malformed data).

2. **Update the `POLICIES` list**:
   - Replace outdated policies with modern priorities for Codetropolis.
   - Example: Focus on sustainability, smart city initiatives, and inclusivity.

3. **Bonus Challenge**:
   - Use the `randomize_policies` function to add a feature where the mayor can shuffle the policies intentionally for fun speeches.
