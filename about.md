In the world of modern development, GitHub has been at the forefront of empowering developers with tools that simplify coding and collaboration. But what happens when you combine GitHub's powerful suite of tools—like **GitHub Workspace** and **GitHub Copilot**—with a fun, immersive learning experience?

You get **Workspace Adventures: The Codetropolis Chronicles**—a workshop that takes participants on a thrilling journey to restore order to a virtual city powered entirely by code.

### **What is Codetropolis? 🏙️**

Codetropolis is a city unlike any other—one that exists in the digital realm, powered by code. The city is home to various systems that manage everything from public speeches to city maps and newsfeeds. But chaos has struck, and it’s up to the participants to restore the city to its former glory.

The catch? Every participant is a **Bugbuster**—a coder tasked with fixing issues, implementing features, and keeping the city running smoothly. And the best part is that they get to do all of this using **GitHub Copilot Workspace**.

### **Why GitHub Workspace? 🔧**

One of the main goals of this workshop is to give participants a hands-on experience with **GitHub Workspace** and its powerful features. Each task in **Codetropolis** is mapped to an issue in the GitHub repository. Once participants created an issue for their mission (bug fix, feature request, etc.), they could instantly spin up a GitHub Workspace tied to that issue. No need for complex setup or configuration—everything they needed was ready for them to dive straight into solving the challenge.

### **The Mission Structure 🚀**

We broke the **Codetropolis** workshop into several missions, each with its own unique set of challenges. Here's a peek at the missions that participants worked on:

1.  **The Mayor’s Broken Speech 🗣️**
    -   The mayor’s speech generator had broken, causing delays in public announcements. Participants had to fix the code to restore order and update city policies.
    
2.  **News Gone Wild 📰**
    -   The city’s newsfeed was overflowing with duplicate stories, and pagination was broken. Developers had to fix the duplicate issue and implement pagination for a smoother news experience.
    
3.  **Missing Maps 🗺️**
    -   The city’s maps had gone missing, leaving citizens lost. This mission required restoring the maps and adding route suggestions to help people navigate the city.

Each of these missions is presented as a **GitHub Issue** templat, which participants can use to get started. They could open a **GitHub Workspace** directly from the issue and get straight to solving the problem.

### **The Workflow 🚀**

Here’s how the typical workflow looked for each mission:
1.  **Create an Issue**: Participants would head to the **Issues** tab in the GitHub repository, create a new issue, and use one of the templates to create the issue.
2.  **Start a Workspace**: From the issue page, they could start a GitHub Workspace.
3.  **Work on the Task**: Using the workspace, developers explored project files, debugged, and wrote code. GitHub Copilot was there to help with suggestions.
4.  **Test in GitHub Codespaces**: When ready, they could switch to **GitHub Codespaces** to run, debug, and test their code in a fully-configured cloud environment.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Once their solution was ready, they submitted a pull request from their fork and marked the issue as resolved.

### **Conclusion: Learning Made Fun 🎉**

By combining **GitHub Workspace** with the exciting missions of **Codetropolis**, we were able to create a workshop that was both fun and educational. Developers didn’t just learn about GitHub Workspace, they got hands-on experience solving real problems.
